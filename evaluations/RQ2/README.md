This directory provides training scripts, evaluation notebooks, and statistical analysis materials to support RQ2 for simulated labeling inconsistency.

## Directory Contents

- [`an_a_priori_power_analysis_for_ANOVA.ipynb`](./an_a_priori_power_analysis_for_ANOVA.ipynb)  
  Notebook performing an a priori power analysis for ANOVA to determine the minimum sample size required to detect the effects of labeling inconsistency with sufficient statistical power.

- [`training_scripts_and_models/`](./training_scripts_and_models/)  
  Contains all training scripts and model checkpoints used for simulating various levels of labeling inconsistency in training data.

- [`RQ2_evaluation.ipynb`](./RQ2_evaluation.ipynb)  
Jupyter notebook for evaluating the trained models with labeling inconsistencies to address **Research Question 2 (RQ2)**. It reproduces the evaluation results reported in the paper.
