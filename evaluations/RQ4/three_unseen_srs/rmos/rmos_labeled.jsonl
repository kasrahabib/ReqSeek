{"id": 111435, "text": "The system merges various hardware and software elements and further interfaces with external systems.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111436, "text": "Thus, while the software covers the majority of the system's functionality, it relies on a number of external interfaces for persistence and unhandled tasks, as well as physically interfacing with humans.", "label": "auxiliary"}

{"id": 111440, "text": "These three user interfaces are the Surface Computer UI, Tablet UI and Display UI.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111441, "text": "The Surface Computer UI is the interface used by restaurant customers.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111442, "text": "This interface uses the surface computer paradigm - users interact with the system by dragging 'objects' around on the flat-screen touch-sensitive display.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111443, "text": "For the RMOS, users can manipulate objects such as items of food, dietary requirements, tips and menus on the surface of their table.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111444, "text": "Such objects can be moved into static objects such as meals and payments to perform various functions.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111445, "text": "In addition to this object manipulation paradigm, a limited system menu is necessary.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111446, "text": "Users will summon their restaurant menu, which is combined with a system/command menu, using an easy touch gesture, a double-tap on the touch surface, and dismiss it with a similar gesture or by tapping a close button GUI element.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111447, "text": "The GUI will take a small percentage of the table's screen, so the UI will be clear and uncluttered.", "label": "auxiliary"}

{"id": 111449, "text": "This UI will be designed for use with a stylus input into the touch-screen.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111450, "text": "Because the number of operations the UI needs to support is relatively limited, there will be no nested menu structure.", "label": "auxiliary"}

{"id": 111455, "text": "Input is provided by fingertips, as opposed to a stylus.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111456, "text": "There are three external hardware devices used by the RMOS, each related to a user interface (see Section 2.1.2).", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111457, "text": "These devices are the surface computers, the wireless tablets and the touch displays.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111458, "text": "All three devices must be physically robust and immune to liquid damage and stains.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111459, "text": "The devices (with the possible exception of displays) must also have good industrial design aesthetics, as they are to be used in place of normal restaurant tables and notepads and will be in direct contact with customers.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111460, "text": "The devices behave as 'terminals' in the sense that they never have a full system image, do not store data and are not used for the core logic of the system.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111461, "text": "However, they should be fully capable computers that can use textual data from the server along with local UI/interpretation code to display UI elements and take input.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111462, "text": "All order and transaction records should be stored on the server, not these computers.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111463, "text": "The performance of dumb terminals over an area the size of a restaurant is likely to be unacceptable.", "label": "auxiliary"}
{"id": 111464, "text": "In all three cases, the hardware device takes information from the RMOS and processes the information to display.", "label": "auxiliary"}
