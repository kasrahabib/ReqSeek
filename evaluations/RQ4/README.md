This directory supports the evaluation of model generalizability beyond controlled experimental setups, using real-world Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) documents.

## Repository Contents

- [`three_real_world_srs/`](./three_unseen_srs/)  
  Contains three real-world SRS documents used for **out-of-distribution evaluation**.  

The original licenses for the remaining two SRS (NTP and RMOS) documents are provided within each subdirectory. Users are requested to read and comply with their licensing terms before use. 

- [`RQ4_evaluation.ipynb`](./RQ4_evaluation.ipynb)  
  Jupyter notebook containing results for **Research Question 4 (RQ4)**. This notebook assesses the ability of **ReqSeek** to generalize to out-of-distribution SRS documents not seen during training.
